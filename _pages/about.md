I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science and Technology from Tianjin University in November 2025, under the supervision of [**Prof. Xiaohong Li**](https://cic.tju.edu.cn/faculty/lxh/index.html) . My research focuses on AI security and software testing, including deep learning framework testing, deep learning model testing, and protocol fuzzing. Since January 2026, I have been working as a **postdoctoral** researcher at **Singapore Management University** with [**Prof. Xiaofei Xie**](https://xiaofeixie.bitbucket.io/), where my current research explores the reliability, robustness, and security of AI-enabled systems.
