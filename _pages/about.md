I'm a Ph.D. candidate from **Tianjin University**. My research focuses on AI security and software testing including DL framework testing, DL model testing, and protocol fuzzing.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [**Prof. Xiaohong Li**](https://cic.tju.edu.cn/faculty/lxh/index.html) of Tianjin University and [**Prof. Xiaofei Xie**](https://xiaofeixie.bitbucket.io/) of Singapore Management University (SMU).

You can find my CV here: [Lili Quan's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf).
